# This is Minesweeper made in Python

To run this code you need to install Pyglet:
```
pip install pyglet
```

There is nothing else needed besides Pyglet. Just run main.py and play the game I really love!

You can play in fullscreen mode by pressing f11.

Warning: the layers are broken in new versions of pyglet.
